# ?


<!--
Let met start with a question. Who's been taught how to navigate a large codebase? 
Not necessarily TypeScript or React but any codebase.
Anyone? 
Anyone endorsed by others for this skill on LinkedIn?
Yeah, me neither

<!-- 
Here's what we're going to do. 
1. Find an open source repo
2. Find an issue that's been solved
3. Use it as a way to learn how to navigate the codebase

After this, do live searching on GitHub. 
Clone and go through steps.
