Let met start with a question. Who's been taught how to navigate a large codebase?
Not necessarily TypeScript or React but any codebase.
Anyone?
Anyone endorsed by others for this skill on LinkedIn?

Here's what we're going to do.
1. Find an open source repo
2. Find an issue that's been solved
3. Use it as a way to learn how to navigate the codebase

After this, do live searching on GitHub.
Clone and go through steps.
